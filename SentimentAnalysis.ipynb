      "I was quite pleased with the condition of this book, as well as it's hardcover, and the footnotes, definitions, and reading reviews for beginner readers of the genre. I am, of course, a huge fan of the Scarlet Letter itself and this copy served its purpose well. One of the few disappointments was that the color of the cover seems to look a little more coral, or pink, than scarlet or red. Also, the back cover is white, and I am most definitely one for appearances. I would have like a slightly more classic looking cover. Nonetheless, the binding will look fair on my bookshelf. Over all the book was clean and well taken care of, and was shipped to me with great haste; A Good Buy.\n",

      "I did not read much of this book, however, I do remember some of it. Often when I discuss comparative literature, I tend to use the example of Charlse Dickens's \"A Tale of Two Cities\", for in Dickens's famous novel, there are about five hundred pages of mere background information. And so, we have the style of Nathaniel Hawthorne presented to us: he is, in essence, a lover of symbolism and all things literarily analyzed. I really got into the story when the first pyre scene happened... Now, note, when I said pyre I meant pillar, for pyres are something entirely different and generally greek/medieval... Anyway, as I was saying, Hawthorned loves literary symbolism and creativity. I love the way he ended the plot, but I think that the story line could have moved a little faster, thus giving \"The Scarlet Letter\" a Dickens-like quality.\n",

Unlike most people, I read this novel in college (I don't know why junior high teaches this book; it's way to advanced for that intensity of reading) and depicted it as a soap opera in Puritan society. The novel inhibits sex, suspense, drama, and romance all in one pakage. I found the invidious Roger Chillingwoth to be an extremely interesting aspect about the novel's well-rounded plot. The theme of the novel is sin, and how tragically easy it could destroy a normal town denizen. I mean, all 3 main characters are virtually consumed and eventually destroyed by their own private sins. Read this book; by doing so, one will appreciate truly powerful literature that still shakes our foundation today.\n",

If you elevate your reading to that next level, where you're seeing beyond the simple plot and percieving Hawthorne's masterful use of symbolism and metaphor, and are able to appreciate probably the last great novel written in before the literary revival of the late 1800s, then you'll consider this book a worthwhile read.\n",

I think one reason that I liked it has to do with the fact that I skipped reading the first part, \"The Custom House.\" I didn't read it when the teacher told the class to read it, and I wrote a paper on it and got an A.All in all, a good book, but I don't think I would've gotten through more than half of it if I hadn't been pushed into it by my English class. Looking back, though, I'm glad I read it because a lot of other works have some thing(s) in common with \"The Scarlet Letter,\" and it would be a shame to graduate with a degree in English without reading it.\n",

The way in which Hawthorne captures the shame that Hetser , the wearer of the scarlet letter, feels everyday and the utter torment that the weak Dimmesdale is in by not coming forth and saying he slept with Hester and the revenge ridden character of Chillingworth is spectactular.The way in which Hawthorne describes the setting and the actions that characters do is truly outstanding. Hawthorne has a huge flare for the dramatic which is great for the reader. Since Hester the main character concieved her daughter Pearl through an affair she has been snetenced to wear the scarlet A on her chest for the rest of her life. The story starts on the day Hester is to stand infront of the town and wear her badge of shame and all the drama in the small puritanical town of Boston starts from there.

Once i knew more about the story, reading became much easier. (some parts, though were just plain tedious.) the imagry that was used was amazing and the plot was excelent. i would have given more stars but some of it was just too complicated and i couldn't follow it.Bottom line: everyone should read this book because it is a classic for a reason.

The author is completely detached from his audience, and for some bizarre reason, he feels he has to explain every little thing that happens in great detail. It is also irrelevant to our modern times. In our days people need to be reading things like Huxley, Orwell, Fitzgerald, Bradbury, Hemmingway, Steinbeck, Salinger, and many other great 20th century writers. This book is only relevant to those interested in the time period which it discusses.\n",

      "I had to read this book, which I had heard quite a bit about, for school but after reading it I had no idea why it is considered such a classic. There is no question that the language is old-fashioned and difficult, but that isn't the only problem I found with it. The whole story was rather boring. It seemed that the author tried to make a lightweight story about an affair and the child that was a product of it deeper or more important by describing how the characters felt. The book was not exactly bad, but, like many other books, it does not really deserve its status as a classic. I saw it more as a book that showed somewhat the morals and ideas of the Puritans. While it is good in that sense, I don't think that it is very important in modern times, and it certainly wasn't a fun read.\n",

      "The whole time reading The Scarlet Letter I thought that it was just extremely interesting. The characters were well-developed and at times, endearing. The way that Hawthorne is able to describe the torture that Reverend Dimmesdale undergoes is very believable. Although I am only thirteen years old and have never committed adultery, I find it easy to relate to Hester Prynne. And Pearl, my most favorite of all the characters, just adds a very interesting touch to the story. Despite the good characters, I did not like the fact that during most of the book, parts of the main plot are dismissed for chapters at a time to describe something not always commpletely relevent to the story. But, overall, I thought this book was very interesting, and would definately take the time to read it.\n",
