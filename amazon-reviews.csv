Written in old English. It was very hard to read as I had to think through most sentences to figure out what was being said.
Thought I was getting a book received book on tape. a little deceiving. Rather than that the process went as expected. If it had been what we wanted would have been great.
this book was recommend 2 me from my neighbor. but i dont think that dis is dat gud of a book 2 recommend... i didnt like it 2 much but...
"I believe that this is a fantastic book for those who have more distinguished tastes. As for others, it is a slow read with challenging vocabulary."
I always liked this book. The kindle version is kind of difficult to navigate but it does its purpose. I can still go back to my last read without any problem.
"Hawthorne wrote a masterful work of historical fiction incorporating an examination of guilt, revenge and suffering in the context of Puritan Salem. Here is a book that speaks to any age about timeless themes. The Scarlet Letter is one of those books that may have force fed to one during grade school but revisited from the perspective of adulthood it is a very fine example of great writing from a true American master."
"I was quite pleased with the condition of this book, as well as it's hardcover, and the footnotes, definitions, and reading reviews for beginner readers of the genre. I am, of course, a huge fan of the Scarlet Letter itself and this copy served its purpose well. One of the few disappointments was that the color of the cover seems to look a little more coral, or pink, than scarlet or red. Also, the back cover is white, and I am most definitely one for appearances. I would have like a slightly more classic looking cover. Nonetheless, the binding will look fair on my bookshelf. Over all the book was clean and well taken care of, and was shipped to me with great haste; A Good Buy."
I know this is a classic but I just could not get into the story. Thought I would try electronic books but I need the paper feel when reading.
"I did not read much of this book, however, I do remember some of it. Often when I discuss comparative literature, I tend to use the example of Charlse Dickens's ""A Tale of Two Cities"", for in Dickens's famous novel, there are about five hundred pages of mere background information. And so, we have the style of Nathaniel Hawthorne presented to us: he is, in essence, a lover of symbolism and all things literarily analyzed. I really got into the story when the first pyre scene happened... Now, note, when I said pyre I meant pillar, for pyres are something entirely different and generally greek/medieval... Anyway, as I was saying, Hawthorned loves literary symbolism and creativity. I love the way he ended the plot, but I think that the story line could have moved a little faster, thus giving ""The Scarlet Letter"" a Dickens-like quality."
"I had to read The Scarlett Letter for my honors english 3 class. I found that the author was too verbose in describing people, places, situations, and just the story in general. The book was so wordy, I often found myself forgetting the topic of that particular paragraph. Also, I was disturbed to find out that ever day the Reverand A. Dimmesdale would beat himself, and stay up till the early morning hours!"
"I read this ""Classic"" novel for a class, and must admit I was thoroughly disappointed. Hawthorne should have stuck to writing non-fictional books about the Puritan settlers. This book was a pill. There are so many American authors, and novels that could be taught in schools that could far exceed the entertainment level of this out of date story. Two thumbs down."
"I am not one who enjoys romance, however Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter is truely an unshakable landmark in American Literature. Unlike most people, I read this novel in college (I don't know why junior high teaches this book; it's way to advanced for that intensity of reading) and depicted it as a soap opera in Puritan society. The novel inhibits sex, suspense, drama, and romance all in one pakage. I found the invidious Roger Chillingwoth to be an extremely interesting aspect about the novel's well-rounded plot. The theme of the novel is sin, and how tragically easy it could destroy a normal town denizen. I mean, all 3 main characters are virtually consumed and eventually destroyed by their own private sins. Read this book; by doing so, one will appreciate truly powerful literature that still shakes our foundation today."
i liked good book from the past....great that we can look back on these great books and enjoy them .
"Scarlet Letter is a kind of book that you understand it and you love it or you dont understand it and hate it. I think this deserves four stars because of the idea of the book. A stand for adultry in this book and tells the story of puritans in that time period. Hester and Pearl faces lots of insult in this community and if you want to find out whot the secret father of Pearl is READ the BOOK!!! But I would recommend to read this book after you are 14 years, because the Idea of the book is too matured."
"This book is one of the last masterpieces written as American literature moved from what we call ""Old English"" (use the much cliched Olde if you must) to ""New English."" And trust me, it shows. Virtually every book ever written during this period, (essentially, before Twain's Huckleberry Finn), bears the same markings - incredibly lavish diction, complex structure and syntax, and all the elements that make for a generally hard to follow novel. If you elevate your reading to that next level, where you're seeing beyond the simple plot and percieving Hawthorne's masterful use of symbolism and metaphor, and are able to appreciate probably the last great novel written in before the literary revival of the late 1800s, then you'll consider this book a worthwhile read."
"This book has to be one of the most tedious works of literature ever written. Hawthorne is a great writer, but I don't know how this book made it into that sacred list we call ""classics"". Perhaps on the merit of his name alone?"
"The Scarlet Letter shows Nathaniel Hawthorne at his finest. The imagery is quite wonderful, but there's only so many times you can say the same thing. The images in this novel stretch out far longer than needed.I nearly couldn't make it through. I do like to see every detail given it's fullest attention but even this is too much.This book is one that is very vivid and quite pleasing to understand, but hard to read and not as easy to follow. Sometimes there's only one resourceful fact in a half a page paragraph.Recommended."
Thie book isnt terrible I had to read it for my AP English class and so far it has been the easiest read. I would recommend it to anyone who likes books of that time frame.. The language uses a lot of thee's and thou's
i couldn't listen to this book because the women reading it has such a screechy horrible voice so i can give no review of the actual book but whatever you do try to find a version with a different reader if you're into audio books
"I've always wanted to read this and when I got the chance, I was a bit disappointed. The language was difficult for me to grasp and there were few scenes that I understood what was going on. After reading this, I don't understand why it is a classic. Although the message of the book was clear, the Shakespeareian-style writing was hard for me to understand."
"I finally got around to reading this classic work last year and was quite disappointed. I tend to limit my reading these days to two primary realms, classic literature and early 20th Century fiction, and this one just didn't measure up to the standard set by other famous authors of Hawthorne's day.It's a simple story about scandal and I guess I was expecting so much more. I wish I could say it was superbly-written but I think that it reflects a lack of committed effort on Hawthorne's part."
"I liked this book as I was reading it. It was really interesting to see Puritan life through Hester Prynne's eyes. I think one reason that I liked it has to do with the fact that I skipped reading the first part, ""The Custom House."" I didn't read it when the teacher told the class to read it, and I wrote a paper on it and got an A.All in all, a good book, but I don't think I would've gotten through more than half of it if I hadn't been pushed into it by my English class. Looking back, though, I'm glad I read it because a lot of other works have some thing(s) in common with ""The Scarlet Letter,"" and it would be a shame to graduate with a degree in English without reading it."
"I will never understand why they force this book on school children, I'm sure there are many other ""classic"" stories that could be included in the curriculum."
Well I read this book and it amazed me. The first time I read this book I thought it was stupid. page after page it got better. Well this book is about a girl who commits an adultery. The girl's name is Hester. So she gets an A on her dress and she goes to prison. Her husband left her like a coward. and I don't want to ruin the story so I will recomend this book to anyone who wants a good read. When I read this book i thought it was hard comepare to the books LORD OF THE FILES and THE ANIMAL FARM. so just read THE SCARLET LETTER.
"Hawthorne has written a book deeply in psychological symbolism and wordy sentences. This book is for those with enough patience to let a deluded, complex story develop -- not a story for me, even though I have read many in the genre."
"The best book that I have ever been assigned to read for school by far. The way in which Hawthorne captures the shame that Hetser , the wearer of the scarlet letter, feels everyday and the utter torment that the weak Dimmesdale is in by not coming forth and saying he slept with Hester and the revenge ridden character of Chillingworth is spectactular.The way in which Hawthorne describes the setting and the actions that characters do is truly outstanding. Hawthorne has a huge flare for the dramatic which is great for the reader. Since Hester the main character concieved her daughter Pearl through an affair she has been snetenced to wear the scarlet A on her chest for the rest of her life. The story starts on the day Hester is to stand infront of the town and wear her badge of shame and all the drama in the small puritanical town of Boston starts from there. A must read for any American."
"I, as a 10th grade student, had to read The Scarlet Letter for school. at first, what came to mind was ""this is going to be the most boring, hard to read book ever, as most school books are."" I started reading it and my nightmares were coming true. i didn't understand half of what Hawthorne was trying to say. this really put me down but once we started discussing the chapters that we had read, i realized what it was about and how good it actually is. Once i knew more about the story, reading became much easier. (some parts, though were just plain tedious.) the imagry that was used was amazing and the plot was excelent. i would have given more stars but some of it was just too complicated and i couldn't follow it.Bottom line: everyone should read this book because it is a classic for a reason. (it really is a good book) but you might want to get a guide to it or maybe cliffnotes so it is esier to understand."
"No, I'm not talking about Hester's crime. I'm talking about this STUPID BOOK! If only Hawthorne had kept his job in the customs house (see prologue), this abomination would never have been spawned from the cess-ridden depths of Hawthorne's twisted thinking organ. (You can figure THAT out on your own). This book is untolerably boring (the only proven cure of insomnia - if you don't mind the side effects) and the descriptions are ridiculously entangling. In the words of Mr. Hawthorne himself, this book is ""ignominiously"" dull. PRESERVE YOUR SANITY! NEVER READ THIS! NEVER!I sleep now..."
"If you can read and readily understand old-english, you *may* be able to enjoy this novel.I found it painfully long and didn't even care to finish it, which is unheard of for me!"
"It shocks me that the Scarlet Letter is the most taught book in the nation. It may have much symbolism and so on, but it is a convoluted mess. The author is completely detached from his audience, and for some bizarre reason, he feels he has to explain every little thing that happens in great detail. It is also irrelevant to our modern times. In our days people need to be reading things like Huxley, Orwell, Fitzgerald, Bradbury, Hemmingway, Steinbeck, Salinger, and many other great 20th century writers. This book is only relevant to those interested in the time period which it discusses."
"Quick read because the book is really a short story and some of the character language can be annoying but necessary per the theme of the novel . Interesting read especially since the book was written in the late 1800s but set in our future. Not your typical ""end of the world"" novel with all the ""glitter"" and multiple story lines like Earth Abides (same genre) but for being written so long ago the author hit the nail on the head per the cascading long-term effects of a ""Scarlet"" event."
a classic book where there is really nothing bad to say about. AS an adult though one can appreciate it more because we choose to read the book instead of it being an assignment that needs to be completed for school.
"I had to read this book, which I had heard quite a bit about, for school but after reading it I had no idea why it is considered such a classic. There is no question that the language is old-fashioned and difficult, but that isn't the only problem I found with it. The whole story was rather boring. It seemed that the author tried to make a lightweight story about an affair and the child that was a product of it deeper or more important by describing how the characters felt. The book was not exactly bad, but, like many other books, it does not really deserve its status as a classic. I saw it more as a book that showed somewhat the morals and ideas of the Puritans. While it is good in that sense, I don't think that it is very important in modern times, and it certainly wasn't a fun read."
"This book was purchased for my daughter for a class. I remember reading it in high school and yeap, still almost as drawn out as it was back then. We both think the same thing. But, a good read nonetheless."
"A classic? Hardly. In it's time this book may have ruffled feathers but these days it's a struggle to get through. Hawthorne's writing style is dreary and dreadful; if captivating readers was his aim, he failed miserably."
"The whole time reading The Scarlet Letter I thought that it was just extremely interesting. The characters were well-developed and at times, endearing. The way that Hawthorne is able to describe the torture that Reverend Dimmesdale undergoes is very believable. Although I am only thirteen years old and have never committed adultery, I find it easy to relate to Hester Prynne. And Pearl, my most favorite of all the characters, just adds a very interesting touch to the story. Despite the good characters, I did not like the fact that during most of the book, parts of the main plot are dismissed for chapters at a time to describe something not always commpletely relevent to the story. But, overall, I thought this book was very interesting, and would definately take the time to read it."
